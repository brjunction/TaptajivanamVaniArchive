In 2019, during His Holiness Haladhara Swami’s European tour in France, at ISKCON New Mayapura, His Holiness Haladhara Swami expressed his cherished desire to create a platform where all audio lectures of his spiritual master would be available for everyone. He aimed to explain the mission of his spiritual master, emphasizing that everything is present in Srila Prabhupada's books and that there is no need to seek teachings outside of ISKCON.

In 2020, with the assistance of his disciples and followers, His Holiness Haladhara Swami curates daily selections of quotes and lectures. These lectures are then transformed into small audio clips that capture the essence of his revered Gurudeva's teachings.
